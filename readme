First the sql scripts should be run to create a database and tables and to fill the table with some values
Then we can run the app to perform the crud operations.
I have also restricted access to URL's based on roles.
This method takes use of spring Data JPA to perform CRUD operations so we didn't had to implement the crud functions.
If we also use Spring Data REST package in our app then we don't need to even expose the endpoints , they will be exposed automatically.
